<h1>Your Sign Language Bridge</h1>

**Bimbing** is a React Native-based mobile application designed to bridge the communication gap between deaf and hearing friends in Indonesia. This application focuses on translating Indonesian Sign Language (SIBI).

## ðŸŽ¯ Background
Communication is the key to social inclusion. Many deaf people in Indonesia face obstacles when interacting with the general public who do not understand sign language. This project aims to provide practical and accessible communication tools via smartphones.

## âœ¨ Main Features
- **Translate Me**: Translates typed words or sentences into visual guides in the form of a series of SIBI sign language slides, allowing users to learn and respond.
- **Transcribe Me**: Uses the device's camera to detect hand movements (SIBI alphabet) and translate them directly into text on the screen.
